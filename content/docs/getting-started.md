# Getting Started

Welcome to the **ReactDocs** framework. This page demonstrates a standard documentation layout.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything! This runs entirely in the browser using a virtual file system.

## Usage

Create `.md` files and organize them into folders.

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```
